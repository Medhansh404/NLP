# NLP_Round_1
Natural language processing, or NLP, is a crucial area of study within artificial intelligence that makes it easier for computers and people to communicate with each other. Natural Language Processing (NLP) aims to give computers the ability to understand, interpret, and use human language. With the help of the libraries already available in Python, this project aims to explore the complexities of natural language processing (NLP), reveal the basic algorithms that underpin text processing, and highlight the applications of these techniques. This paper functions as a thorough manual, explaining the successive steps that we took in our investigation, and it is supplemented by graph-based data visualisations to help readers have a better understanding of the text and its NLP applications.

The central focus of our endeavour is the interpretation of Mahatma Gandhi's famous autobiographical work, "The Story of My Experiments with Truth." Our main goal is to use a variety of NLP approaches and strategies to draw insightful conclusions from the text that illuminate its underlying qualities and linguistic complexity. By doing this, we hope to demonstrate the tremendous potential of NLP in revealing the profound wisdom contained in this work of literature.
